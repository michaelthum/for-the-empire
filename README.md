# For (loop) the Empire

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the 3 supporting functions called by the `deliverStormTroopersEscapeScene` function are causing the tests to fail. Your task is to rework these 3 functions so that they work as expected, making the tests pass.

## Storm Trooper Orders
* Storm Troopers have standing orders to call out to their fellow troopers every time they see a rebel
* Plot armor allows characters to escape after being spotted. Storm Troopers have standing orders to call out to their fellow troopers every time a rebel escapes
* Storm troopers have standing orders to shoot 4 times every time they see rebels, regardless of whether the rebels have escaped or not
